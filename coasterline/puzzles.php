<p>A London cab driver picked up a lady who was a notorious chatterbox. He did not want to engage in conversation, 
so he pretended to be deaf and dumb. He pointed to his mouth and ears to indicate that he could neither speak nor hear.

Then she realized that he could not have been a deaf mute. How did she know</p>

<p>The boss of a storage warehouse had just arrived at work when one of his employees burst into his office. 
The man said that while asleep in the building the previous night he had dreamt that one of the stored boxes contained a bomb which would explode at two p.m. The boss was sceptical, but agreed to investigate. After a search, a bomb was truly found in the area foreseen in the man's dream. The police were called to defuse the bomb and thus a tragedy was averted. Yet afterwards, the boss after thanking the employee profusely, fired him. The sacked man had not planted the bomb, and his prophetic dream had saved the warehouse from a tragedy. 
Yet the manager was right to fire him. How could that be so?</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onClick="alert('Because he was the night watchman (or some other night shift worker) and had been sleeping on his job. ')">View Answer</a>

<p>A poor servant in a village was told by his master that he could wish for anything he wanted. It could 
be any wish at all but just one. The servant asked his mother what she wanted and she said she wanted a TV set.
Next, the servant asked his wife who said she wanted a microwave. Finally, the servant went to his father who wanted a bicycle. The next day he went to his master and 
made one wish through which his mother, father and wife each got what they wanted. What was his wish?</p>
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onClick="alert('Since it could be any wish at all, he asked for three wishes, thus satisfying everybody! Of course he could also simply ask for a sum large enough to allow him to buy all the three items.')">View Answer</a>
