<h4 class="color-blue">Major reasons for Hair Fall</h4>
<div class="col-md-4"><img src="img/hairfall/hairloss.jpg" alt="hairloss image" title="hairloss image"/></div>
<div class="col-md-8"><p>Hair loss or baldness (technically known as alopecia) is a loss of hair from the head or body.
 Baldness can refer to general hair loss or androgenic alopecia (male pattern baldness). 
 Some types of baldness can be caused by alopecia areata, an autoimmune disorder. The extreme forms of alopecia 
 areata are alopecia totalis, which involves the loss of all head hair, and alopecia universalis, which involves the 
 loss of all hair from the head and the body.</p>
 </div>

<p>Baldness and hypotrichosis can have many causes, including fungal infection (tinea capitis), 
traumatic damage, such as by compulsive pulling (trichotillomania), as a result of radiotherapy or 
chemotherapy, and as a result of nutritional deficiencies such as Iron deficiency, and as a result of autoimmune phenomena, 
including alopecia areata and hair loss associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>

<h4 class="color-blue">Signs and Symptoms</h4>
<p>Symptoms of hairfall include hair loss in patches usually in circular patterns, dandruff, skin lesions, and scarring. 
Hairfall (mild - medium level) usually shows in unusual hair loss areas e.g. eyebrows, backside of the head or above 
the ears where usually the male pattern baldness does not affect. In male-pattern hair loss, loss and thinning begin at the temples and the 
crown and either thins out or falls out. Female-pattern hair loss occurs at the frontal and parietal.</p>

<h5 class="color-blue">Excessive daily hair loss</h5>
<p>People have between 100,000 and 150,000 hairs on their head. The number of strands normally lost in a day varies, 
but on average is 100. In order to maintain a normal volume, hair must be replaced at the same rate at which it is lost. The first signs of hair thinning that people will often notice are more hairs than usual left in the hairbrush after brushing or in the basin after shampooing. 
Styling can also reveal areas of thinning, such as a wider parting or a thinning crown.</p>

<h5 class="color-blue">Skin conditions</h5>
<p>A substantially blemished face, back and limbs could point to cystic acne. The most severe form of the condition, 
cystic acne arises from the same hormonal imbalances that cause hair loss, and is associated with dihydrotestosterone[clarification needed] 
production. Seborrheic dermatitis, a condition in which an excessive amount of sebum is produced and builds up on the scalp 
(looking like an adult cradle cap) is also a symptom of 
hormonal imbalances, as is an excessively oily or dry scalp. Both can cause hair thinning.</p>
<div class="clearfix"></div>

<h5 class="color-blue">Psychological</h5>
<p>Hair thinning and baldness cause psychological stress due to its effect on appearance. Although societal interest 
in appearance has a long history, this particular branch of psychology came into its own during the 1960s and has gained momentum as 
messages associating physical attractiveness with success and happiness grow more prevalent.</p>
<p>The psychology of hair thinning is a complex issue. Hair is considered an essential part of overall identity: 
especially for women, for whom it often represents femininity and attractiveness. Men typically associate a 
full head of hair with youth and vigor. Although they may be aware of pattern baldness in their family, many are 
uncomfortable talking about the issue. Hair thinning is therefore a sensitive issue for both sexes. For sufferers, it can represent a 
loss of control and feelings of isolation. People experiencing hair thinning often find themselves in a situation where their physical 
appearance is at odds with their own self-image and commonly worry that they appear older than they are or less attractive to others.
 Psychological problems due to baldness, if present, are typically most severe at the onset of symptoms.</p>
 <p>Hair loss induced by cancer chemotherapy has been reported to cause changes in self-concept and body image. 
 Body image does not return to the previous state after regrowth of hair for a majority of patients. In such cases, patients 
 have difficulties expressing their feelings (alexithymia) and may be more prone to avoiding family conflicts. 
 Family therapy can help families to cope with these psychological problems if they arise.</p>

<h4 class="color-blue">Causes</h4>
<h5 class="color-blue">Male pattern baldness</h5>
<p>More than 95% of hair loss in men is male pattern baldness (MPB). MPB is characterized by hair receding from the lateral sides of the
 forehead (known as a "receding hairline") and/or a thinning crown (balding to the area known as the 'vertex').
 Both become more pronounced until they eventually meet, leaving a horseshoe-shaped ring of hair around the back of the head.</p>
 <p>The incidence of pattern baldness varies from population to population and is based on genetic background. 
 Environmental factors do not seem to affect this type of baldness greatly. One large scale study in Maryborough, 
 Victoria, Australia showed the prevalence of mid-frontal baldness increases with age and affects 73.5 percent of men and 57 
 percent of women aged 80 and over. A rough rule of thumb is that the incidence of baldness in males corresponds roughly to chronological age. 
 For example, according to Medem Medical Library's website, MPB affects roughly 40 million men in the United States. 
 Approximately one in four men will have noticeable hair loss by age 30,
  and this figure increases to two in three men by age 60. In rare cases, MPB can begin as early as age 12.</p>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h5 class="color-blue">Lack of Nutrition</h5>
<p>Studies have shown that poor nutrition, limited food intake, and deficiencies in certain nutrients can cause thinning. 
These include deficiencies of biotin, protein, zinc and poor human iron metabolism, although complete baldness is not usually seen. 
A diet high in animal fats (often found in fast food) and vitamin A is also thought to lead to hair loss.</p>

<h5 class="color-blue">Infection</h5>
<p>1. Fungal infections</p>
<p>2. A microscopic mite that feeds on the sebum produced by the sebaceous glands, denies hair essential nutrients and can cause thinning. 
Demodex folliculorum is not present on every scalp and is more likely to live in an excessively oily scalp environment.</p>

<h5 class="color-blue">Drugs</h5>
<p>1. Temporary or permanent hair loss can be caused by several medications, including those for blood pressure problems, diabetes, 
heart disease and cholesterol. Any that affect the bodys hormone balance can have a pronounced effect: 
these include the contraceptive pill, hormone replacement therapy, steroids and acne medications.</p>
<p>2. Some treatments used to cure mycotic infections can cause massive hair loss.</p>
<p>3. Medications (side effects from drugs, including chemotherapy, anabolic steroids, and birth control pills</p>

<h5 class="color-blue">Pregnancy</h5>
<p>Hair loss often follows childbirth without causing baldness. In this situation, the hair is actually thicker
 during pregnancy due to increased circulating oestrogens. After the baby is born, the oestrogen levels fall back to normal prepregnancy
  levels, and the additional
 hair foliage drops out. A similar situation occurs in women taking the fertility-stimulating drug clomiphene.</p>
