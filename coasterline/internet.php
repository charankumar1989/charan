<h4 class="color-blue">Do not Share your personals online</h4>
<img src="img/internet/shh.png"/>
<p><b class="color-blue">Do not give out your personal information</b> - Do not put personal details such as your home address, telephone numbers or parents
 work address online as cybercriminals can use this information to create a fake profile with your details</p>
<p><b class="color-blue">What goes online, stays online</b> - Use privacy settings to make sure only your friends and family can see photos you post.
 Avoid posting holiday plans as criminals have been known to track your movements</p>
<p><b class="color-blue">Check your security and privacy settings</b> - Make sure your social network privacy settings are secured so 
only your friends can see your personal information and use your privacy settings to restrict who can see your posts, videos and photos</p>

<p><b class="color-blue">Password safety</b> - Sharing your password with your parents is a sensible idea, but avoid sharing your password with your friends, 
even if they promise they wont tell anyone! Also, when setting your password, make sure it is not something people
 may guess such as your pets name. Use a mixture of letters, numbers and upper and lower case characters</p>
 
<p><b class="color-blue">Always protect your mobile device</b> - Make sure your mobile phone is pin-protected so all your personal 
information stored on it is safe. Download a security app which allows you to remotely wipe any personal data, should your mobile be lost or stolen</p>
 
<p><b class="color-blue">Do not talk to strangers online or offline</b> - Do not meet up with strangers and let your parents know if a 
stranger has tried to get in contact with you online. Often people you speak to online may not be who they say they are so only share your 
personal details on social media sites with friends, family and people you already know in the real world</p>
 
<p><b class="color-blue">Listen to the adults who know</b> - Adults will always be worried about you. Help set their mind at rest and
 avoid chatting online with strangers or using the internet so long you neglect your real world activities and real world friends
Be wary of unsecured or unknown websites - When shopping online, use reputable and known retailers. Make sure any transactions you make
 only take place across secure web pages which you can identify from the padlock sign in your browser address bar and where the address says https
Be careful what links you click on.
 <p><b class="color-blue">Avoid clicking links</b> - In email, Instant Message or on your social network unless you
 are sure the message is from someone you know. Cybercriminals have been known to hack into your friends email accounts and social networks 
 to send emails or post messages claiming they are in trouble and asking you to transfer them money. Do not believe it if it sounds
  suspicious or offers something unrealistic.
<p><b class="color-blue">Make sure your security software is up to date</b> - Security software is now available on all types of devices;
 mobile phones, tablets and PCs. Make sure you have the latest security software on your devices to stay protected at all times.</p>
